# Three-Or-More
Players take turns rolling five dice and score for three-of-a-kind or better. If a player only has two-of-a-kind, they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the remaining dice values. If no matching numbers are rolled after two rolls, the player scores 0.

## Controls
To roll you can enter "1", "roll", "Roll", "yes", "Yes", "y" and "Y".
Or you can quit at any time by entering "0", "no", "No", "n" and "N".
