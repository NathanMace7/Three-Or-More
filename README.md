# Three Or More
Players take turns rolling five dice and score for three-of-a-kind or better. If a player only has two-of-a-kind, they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the remaining dice values. If no matching numbers are rolled after two rolls, the player scores 0.

## Scoring
